skype-installer
===============

This is an installer for Skype in Linux. This package does not contain any program files as the Skype license does not allow distribution. By installing this package You will download, also will make your own rpm (i686, x86_64..), and finally will install Skype (similar to AUR of Arch Linux). You must accept the Skype EULA before using it.
